        <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Pontus Jaensson and I am 24 years old and living in Lund. I originally come from Färjestaden on
            Öland. Currently, I am studying my fifth year of my master here at LTH and I am now looking for job
            opportunities.
            I always look for new challenges and I am interested in taking on new tasks. I see myself as a social person
            who loves solving. problems and I am always eager to spend some extra time to ensure that the result will be
            as
            good as possible. Once I am finished with my education I would like to work in bigger projects where I have
            a large
            responsibility for the entire development process. In the future I would like to develop and improve systems
            that the society will benefit
            from. </p>
        <p>One of my biggest interests is football. I have played football as long as I can remember and I still
            think it is just as fun. I am currently playing at Södra Sandby IF and before that I playedat Lunds SK and
            IFK Berga in
            Kalmar. Football has always been a natural part of my everyday life and it has also introduced me to some of
            my best friends. During this autumn I have found a way of combining my great interest for football with my
            other interest in programming. I have together with my friend developed a program that evaluates the best
            players
            accomplishments in the English Premier League.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Why You Should Hire Me</h2>
        <p> From the very start I will have the required knowledge to be able to contribute to your
            business.
            After a while I will have established myself as a reliable and important member in your team. On a longer
            term, my
            ambition and perseverance will make me a highly valued employee in your organization.</p>
